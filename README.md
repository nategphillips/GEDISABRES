# pyGEONOSIS

Python GEnerated Oxygen and Nitric Oxide SImulated Spectra (pyGEONOSIS) is a general-purpose tool for simulating diatomic spectra. Built using NumPy, Polars, PySide6, PyQtGraph, and SciPy, pyGEONOSIS is designed to be easily understood and modified.

The capabilities of this tool are briefly summarized below. More detailed theory and notation are explained in the included document.

## Background

### Rotational Hamiltonian

The rotational Hamiltonian is computed on a per-term basis according to the molecular term symbol of the molecule in question along with the supplied constants. For more information, see [hamilterm](https://github.com/nategphillips/hamilterm).

### Spectral Broadening

Convolutions include the effects of both Gaussian and Lorentzian broadening mechanisms. Each type of broadening can be toggled on or off individually.

#### Gaussian

- Thermal Doppler broadening
- Instrument broadening

#### Lorentzian

- Pressure broadening
- Natural broadening
- Predissociation broadening (only O2 is supported for now)

### Equilibrium & Non-equilibrium

The translational, electronic, vibrational, and rotational temperatures can be specified separately. Boltzmann population distributions are assumed for now.

### Plot Types

Four plot types are currently implemented:

- Line
  - Each rotational line is plotted at its exact wavenumber.
- Line Info
  - Information is printed above each line for easier identification.
- Convolve Separate
  - The rotational lines within a single vibrational band are convolved.
- Convolve All
  - All vibrational bands are convolved together.

## Validation with Experimental Data

Data for molecular oxygen from the [Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/) is used to verify the output of pyGEONOSIS. Data for the Schumannâ€“Runge bands is available [here](https://lweb.cfa.harvard.edu/amp/ampdata/o2pub92/S-R.html) at 300 K. The (2, 0) and (6, 0) experimental band data were chosen since they contain lines belonging to multiple vibrational bands. The specific bands chosen to emulate the experimental data are shown in the at the top left of the GUI in each image.

## Installation

### From an Executable

Go to the [releases tab](https://github.com/nategphillips/pyGEONOSIS/releases) of this repository and download the latest compressed archive specific to your operating system. Extract the contents and run the binary file contained inside.

### From Source

On your PC, navigate to a directory of your choice and run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nategphillips/pyGEONOSIS
```

to download the source code directly. This repository uses the [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager for Python. Install uv using the instructions on their [website](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Once uv is installed, the packages required for pyGEONOSIS can be added in a virtual environment by navigating to the repository's root directory and installing the dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

Then, navigate to the `src/` directory and run the GUI:

```bash
uv run ./main.py
```

## Roadmap

### GUI Functionality

- [x] Switch to PyQtGraph instead of Matplotlib for improved plot performance
- [x] Add the ability to export rotational line data from the built-in spreadsheet
- [x] Make a custom GUI icon
- [ ] Improve the interface for adding and removing experimental data
- [ ] Design and implement a GUI for LIF computations, including estimated fluorescence yield and the ability to search for rotational line overlaps

### Physics

- [x] Add support for more diatomic molecules, starting with $\text{NO}$
- [ ] Include support for non-Boltzmann temperature distributions
