# Notes on Data for O2

References to Cheung refer to "Molecular spectroscopic constants of O2(B3Σu−): The upper state of the Schumann-Runge bands" by Cheung, et al.

References to Yu refer to "High resolution spectral analysis of oxygen. IV. Energy levels, partition sums, band constants, RKR potentials, Franck-Condon factors involving the X3Σg-, a1Δg, and b1Σg+ states" by Yu et al.

This program uses Herzberg's definition of the band origin, i.e. nu_0 = nu_e + nu_v, which is given on p. 186 of "Spectra of Diatomic Molecules". In the Cheung paper, the electronic energy is defined differently than in Herzberg. The conversion specified by Cheung on p. 5 is nu_0 = T + 2 / 3 * lamda - gamma. This conversion was applied to the raw data used in this program.
